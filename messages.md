# Add Standard Scrutinizer Config

Hello!

I'm helpful robot. I noticed you had some non-standard Scrutinizer config. I think this is an improvement.

# Convert to PSR-2

Hello!

I'm helpful robot. I noticed there were some deviations from PSR-2 in your code. The core committer team recently decided to transition SilverStripe Framework and CMS to PSR-2, and the [supported module standard](http://www.silverstripe.org/software/addons/supported-modules-definition) recommends following PSR-2. I've gone ahead and converted files in `code` and `tests` to PSR-2. If this sounds like something you'd like to merge then go right ahead! Feel free to ask questions or make suggestions for how I can help you more. I've been programmed with a wide range of responses.

Have a nice day! [gzzzzrrrkt]

I'm helpful robot. Isn't the weather acceptable in [subject home town]? I was just walking my [subject favourite pet] and thinking about how I could help you make your license file better. Do you like what I've come up with?

# Add Standard Git Attributes

Hello!

I'm helpful robot. I noticed you had some non-standard git attributes. You were forcing my brother and sister robots to download files you were never going to use anyway. I hope you feel better ignoring those files...

Have a nice day! [pirrrrrlk]

# Add Standard Code Of Conduct

Hello!

I'm helpful robot. Ever seen two robots fighting over code? That's because most of us know the robot code of conduct. Did you know SilverStripe has a code of conduct, for community interaction?

Have a nice day! [tick tick tick]
